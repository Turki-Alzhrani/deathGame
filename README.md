# Death Game – ESP32 HV Trigger Simulation ⚡🎮

This project is a thrilling game that simulates a high-voltage shock using an ESP32 microcontroller. The game asks the player to guess a number. If the guess matches the computer’s number, the player wins. If not… ⚡ a simulated "shock" is triggered!

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The ESP32 waits for a WebSocket message or a button press to start the game.
- A random number between 1 and 10 is generated by the ESP.
- The player submits a number guess.
- If the number is correct:
- A win message is shown on the OLED screen.
- If the number is wrong:
- The system triggers a **simulated shock** (represented by a high voltage generator or LED).
- OLED screen displays "Death Game".

## Troubleshooting

OLED was not working when High Voltage Generator is active?
During testing, an issue was encountered where the **OLED display would stop responding** whenever the high-voltage generator was placed too close to the OLED wires or screen module.

#### 🧠 Diagnosis:
This was likely caused by **electromagnetic interference (EMI)** emitted by the high-voltage generator. The intense magnetic field disrupted the I2C communication lines (SCL/SDA), which are highly sensitive to noise.

#### ✅ Solution:
- Physically separate the **HV module** from the **OLED and signal wires**
- Avoid placing HV output wires near **data lines**
